### What I learned

This was an excellent project to work on creating responsive pages. The biggest challenge for me was to keep the balance between the image and the content section, so that it would look good while resizing the screen. So I started looking for ways of making text more responsive, and using a vw unit instead of rem/em/pixels turned out to be a superb solution to the problem.

### Continued development

I am still not used to positioning background images, so I would like to work more on that in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [The Beginner's Guide to Responsive Text on the Web](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/responsive-text) - This is an amazing article about making web text more responsive.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Bitcamp 101 (Georgia) for amazing lectures, and also, my mentor Paata Gharibashvili who has helped me a lot while working on different projects.
